<b>Hey, I'm Aaron Bird!</b> 

I work as a backend developer mostly with the Microsoft stack proficient in C# development. I am based in Cedar Park Texas.

I have a special interest in modern technology that pushes theboundaries of what back-end development can do. 
All my previous work was in a small team or as an individual full stack developer. 
These roles have allowed me to develop valuable skills which propagate throughout the entire stack of a product. 
As part of a team and an individual – I have been able to implement and deliver performant and highly scalable/reliable applications to the clients at my previous job.

I am currently focusing on learning a broader range of technologies starting with Python.
